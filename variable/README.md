# C Vairable

In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

In C, there are different types of variables with different **data types**. Later chapters we will see _data types_.

## Examples

- **int** - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- **float** - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- **char** - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes

## Rules for naming a variable

1. A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.
2. The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.
3. There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the variable name is **longer than 31 characters.**

## Example

- `int` number = 10;
- `char` letter = 'A';
- `double` price = 99.99;
